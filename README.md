# mysql-server-rapid-plugin-x-protocol

This is the list of protobuf files for the MySQL server's X plugin.

Taken from upstream: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/5.7/rapid/plugin/x/protocol

Copyright as of upstream. These files are split out so that a MySQL X protocol specification
can be made referring to these protocol files without having to refer to the rest of the
MySQL server code.

Initial import as of 5.7. Latest commit on mysql-server 1020e95 on Jul 12 2016.
